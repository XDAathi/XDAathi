## 🔭 What I’m up to

- Building **Ability** – an iOS app that generates custom 3D‑printable assistive devices with a heavy dose of generative AI (Gemini) + Blender wizardry.
- Helping run Canada’s largest AI hackathon, **GenAI Genesis** 🤖🚀.
- Crafting a personal portfolio site from scratch in React/Tailwind because I apparently hate free time.

I also moonlight in 🇨 when assignments forbid `unordered_map` (why tho?).

## 🎯 Current goals

- Crack the secrets of **probabilistic graphical models** without losing my own.
- Land that first ML internship where I can train models _and_ break prod on day 1.
- Smash more powerful badminton smashes (open to racket suggestions 🏸).

## 🌱 Fun facts

- I once lifeguarded at Toronto Pan Am Sports Centre – ask me about chlorine levels at your own risk.
- My code compiles on the first try **exactly** as often as Halley’s comet swings by (next sighting: 2061).
- Favourite Git command: `git commit -m "debugging by rubber duck intimidation"`.
